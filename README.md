# OpenSCAD Raspberry Pi Library

OpenSCAD library of various objects to use in Raspberry Pi-based projects

This is a simple library of objects that I designed to assist 
myself in creating various projects based on the Raspberry Pi. 
The main goal is to have a realistic representation of the size 
of the overall assemble, to aid in building a suitable case for 
the projects. I used the same OpenSCAD software to design 
3D-printed or laser-cut cases.
